Malware analysis

Purpose
When analysing malware, it is important to consider the following:
Point of Entry (PoE) - Ex:spam email
Indicators - Ex:files, processes
How does the malware perform - Ex:RAT

--------------------

Malware Campaigns
Targeted - Ex:DarkHotel malware, stuxnet
Mass Campaign - Ex:WannaCry(eternalblure exploit)

-------------------

Identifying if a Malware Attack has Happened
process of a malware attack can be broken down into a few broad steps:
Delivery - Ex: USB(stuxnet), PDF(phishing)
Execution - Ex: Ransomware, spyware
Maintaining persistence
Persistence - why malware is noisy
Propagation 

Two categories of fingerprints that malware may leave behind on a Host after an attack:
Host-Based Signatures - Ex:file encryption, software installation
Network-Based Signatures

----------

Static Vs. Dynamic Analysis
Static Analysis:
to gain a high-level abstraction of the sample, this method is of the analysis of the sample at the state it presents itself as, without executing the code.
use of techniques such as signature analysis via checksums means quick, efficient and safe analysis of malware.
Dynamic Analysis:
involves executing the sample and observing what happens. 

------------------

Tools and their uses:
Provided Static Analysis Tools:
C:\Users\Analysis\Desktop\Tools\Static\PE Tools
Dependency Walker (depends)
PeID
PE Explorer
PEview
ResourceHacker

C:\Users\Analysis\Desktop\Tools\Static\Disassembly
IDA Freeware
WinDbg

C:\Users\Analysis\Desktop\Tools\Sysinternalsuite
ResourceHacker

C:\Users\Analysis\Desktop\Tools\Dynamic

-------------------

Connecting to the Windows Analysis Environment (Deploy)
Windows instance alongside the additional tools and tasks 
Host will not respond to pings - only the (Remote Desktop Protocol) RDP protocol (3389)
Windows - Default Remote Desktop Terminal
Linux: Any compatible RDP client such as Remmina: sudo apt-get install remmina

Obtaining MD5 Checksums of Provided Files
MD5 "Checksums" are a prominent attribute in the malware Community
These MD5 "Checksums" are cryptographic "fingerprints" of the files. This allows a uniformed identification throughout the community - especially with automated Sandboxes. 
For example, say you have 20 files of unknown origin, you are able to identify their genus using their MD5 sum against websites such as Virustotal, if that MD5 "Checksum" has 
been previously analyzed - removing all the legwork for us!

Navigate to the "Tasks" Folder on the Desktop, and then enter the "Task 7" Directory, where there will be three files:
- aws.exe
- NetLog.exe
- vlc.exe
Just because it says "vlc" doesn't mean it is indeed the VLC application! This is where identifying their MD5 Checksum is useful, as no matter the name - their MD5 reveals 
its true identity.
I have installed the "HashTab" application, which calculates a files MD5 sum - amongst others, directly within Windows Explorer as if you were inspecting its properties...

Identify the MD5 Checksums of the three files provided in "Task 7" (You can use Ctrl + C & Ctrl + V over RDP)
