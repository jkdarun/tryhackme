Transferring Files From Your Host - SCP (SSH)
Secure copy, or SCP
to copy an example file from our machine to a remote machine,
scp important.txt ubuntu@192.168.1.30:/home/ubuntu/transferred.txt
to copy an example file from a remote machine to our machine,
scp ubuntu@192.168.1.30:/home/ubuntu/documents.txt notes.txt 

Serving Files From Your Host - WEB
python has a lightweight module called "HTTPServer" to turn a computer into a web server to serve your own files
Python3's "HTTPServer" will serve the files in the directory that you run the command, but this can be changed
python3 -m  http.server
use wget to download the file using the computer's IP address and the name of the file.
wget http://127.0.0.1:8000/file

SIGTERM - kill and allow cleanup
SIGKILL - kill, no cleanup
SIGSTOP - stop/suspend

Automation
cron process, cronjob
cronjob file has

ex:
0 *12 * * * cp -R /home/Documents /var/backups/
@reboot /var/opt/processes.sh
