Encoding - NOT a form of encryption, just a form of data representation like base64. Immediately reversible.
Passphrase - Separate to the key, a passphrase is similar to a password and used to protect a key.
Standards like PCI-DSS state that the data should be encrypted both at rest (in storage) AND while being transmitted.

Types of encryption
1. Symmetric encryption - uses same key to encrypt and decrypt data. Ex: DES (Broken) and AES. Faster than asymmetric cryptography, and use smaller keys (128 or 256 bit keys are common for AES, DES keys are 56 bits long).
2. Asymmetric encryption - uses a pair of keys, public key and private key,one to encrypt and the other to decrypt. Ex: RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography. Slower and uses larger keys, for example RSA typically uses 2048 to 4096 bit keys.

RSA - Rivest Shamir Adleman
Tools for defeating RSA challenges in CTFs, https://github.com/Ganapati/RsaCtfTool and https://github.com/ius/rsatool.
The key variables for RSA in CTFs : p, q, m, n, e, d, and c.
“p” and “q” are large prime numbers, “n” is the product of p and q.
The public key is n and e, the private key is n and d.
“m” is used to represent the message (in plaintext) and “c” represents the ciphertext (encrypted text).

Establishing Keys Using Asymmetric Cryptography
A symmetric encryption key is encrypted using the server’s public key and sent to the server which can be decrypted using the server’s private key only.
Asymmetric cryptography is used only once, so it’s fast, and you can now communicate privately with symmetric encryption.
In reality, to verify the person you’re talking to is who they say they are, is done using digital signatures and certificates.

Digital signatures and Certificates
Digital signatures 
A way to prove the authenticity of files, to prove who created or modified them. Using asymmetric cryptography, you produce a signature with your private key and it can be verified using your public key.
Certificates 
Also a key use of public key cryptography, linked to digital signatures. A common place where they’re used is for HTTPS. 
The web server has a certificate that says it is the real tryhackme.com. The certificates have a chain of trust, starting with a root CA (certificate authority). Root CAs are automatically trusted by your device, OS, or browser from install. Certs below that are trusted because the Root CAs say they trust that organisation. Certificates below that are trusted because the organisation is trusted by the Root CA and so on. There are long chains of trust.
