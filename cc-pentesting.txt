netcat

Tool that allows users to connect to specific ports and send and receive data.
It also allows machines to receive data and connections on specific ports, which makes nc a very popular tool to gain a Reverse Shell.
After you connect to a port with nc you can send data, this means, the user can pipe data through nc. 
ex:
echo hello | nc <ip> 1234 
to send the string hello to the service running on port 1234

-l    (listen for connections)
-v    (verbose mode(allows you to see who connected to you))
-p    (specify a port to listen on)
-e    (specify which program to execute after you connect to a host)
-u    (connect to UDP ports)

gobuster

In web penetration testing, basic reconnaissance can tell where some files and directories are. However, some of them are hidden stuff. gobuster tries to find valid directories from a wordlist of possible directories. gobuster can also be used to valid subdomains using the same method.
