nmap

-p    (to specify port)
-sn   (ping scan-just tests if host is up)
-su   (UDP scan)
-sc   (to run default scripts)
-A    (to enable aggressive mode-Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)
-o    (for OS detection)
-sv   (to get versions of services running)

netcat

Tool that allows users to connect to specific ports and send and receive data.
It also allows machines to receive data and connections on specific ports, which makes nc a very popular tool to gain a Reverse Shell.
After you connect to a port with nc you can send data, this means, the user can pipe data through nc. 
ex:
echo hello | nc <ip> 1234 
to send the string hello to the service running on port 1234

-l    (listen for connections)
-v    (verbose mode(allows you to see who connected to you))
-p    (specify a port to listen on)
-e    (specify which program to execute after you connect to a host)
-u    (connect to UDP ports)

gobuster

In web penetration testing, basic reconnaissance can tell where some files and directories are. However, some of them are hidden stuff. gobuster tries to find valid directories from a wordlist of possible directories. gobuster can also be used to valid subdomains using the same method.

dir   (to specify directory/file brute forecing mode)
dns   (to specify dns bruteforcing mode)
-x    (sets extensions, Example: if the php extension is set, and word is "admin", gobuster will test admin.php      against the webserver)
-w    (sets a wordlist to be used)
-u    (set the Username for basic authentication(If the directory requires a username/password))
-p    (set the password for basic authentication)
-s    (set which status codes gobuster will interpret as valid.Example: 200,400,404,204)
-k    (skip ssl certificate verification)
-a    (specify a User-Agent)
-h    (specify a HTTP header)
-u    (sets the URL to bruteforce)

started the machine given.
Q1)What is the name of the hidden directory 
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.179.238/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
gave output as /secret

Q2)What is the name of the hidden file with the extension xxa
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.179.238/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -x xxa
gave output as password.xxa
