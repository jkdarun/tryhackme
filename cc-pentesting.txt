nmap

-p    (to specify port)
-sn   (ping scan-just tests if host is up)
-su   (UDP scan)
-sc   (to run default scripts)
-A    (to enable aggressive mode-Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)
-o    (for OS detection)
-sv   (to get versions of services running)

-------------------
netcat

Tool that allows users to connect to specific ports and send and receive data.
It also allows machines to receive data and connections on specific ports, which makes nc a very popular tool to gain a Reverse Shell.
After you connect to a port with nc you can send data, this means, the user can pipe data through nc. 
ex:
echo hello | nc <ip> 1234 
to send the string hello to the service running on port 1234

-l    (listen for connections)
-v    (verbose mode(allows you to see who connected to you))
-p    (specify a port to listen on)
-e    (specify which program to execute after you connect to a host)
-u    (connect to UDP ports)

------------------
gobuster

In web penetration testing, basic reconnaissance can tell where some files and directories are. However, some of them are hidden stuff. gobuster tries to find valid directories from a wordlist of possible directories. gobuster can also be used to valid subdomains using the same method.

dir   (to specify directory/file brute forecing mode)
dns   (to specify dns bruteforcing mode)
-x    (sets extensions, Example: if the php extension is set, and word is "admin", gobuster will test admin.php      against the webserver)
-w    (sets a wordlist to be used)
-u    (set the Username for basic authentication(If the directory requires a username/password))
-p    (set the password for basic authentication)
-s    (set which status codes gobuster will interpret as valid.Example: 200,400,404,204)
-k    (skip ssl certificate verification)
-a    (specify a User-Agent)
-h    (specify a HTTP header)
-u    (sets the URL to bruteforce)

started the machine given.
Q1)What is the name of the hidden directory 
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.179.238/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
gave output as /secret

Q2)What is the name of the hidden file with the extension xxa
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.179.238/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -x xxa
gave output as password.xxa

nikto
nikto is a popular web scanning tool that allows users to find common web vulnerabilities. It is commonly used to check for common CVE's such as shellshock, and to get general information about the web server that you're enumerating. 

-h        (to specify the host to use)
-nossl    (disables ssl)
-ssl      (force ssl)
-id       (specify authentication-username+password)
-plugins  (to select which plugin to use)
apacheusers (a plugin to check if you can enumerate apache users)
-update   (to update plugin list)
-list-plugins   (to list all plugins)

-------------------
Metasploit
Metasploit is one of the most popular penetration testing frameworks around. It contains a large database of almost every major CVE, which you can easily use against a machine. 

setting up

msfconsole command
running this will present an "msf6" prompt - can enter commands now
search      (to search modules)
help        (to get all the commands and usage)
use         (to select a module)
info        (to display information about a specific module)
options     (to list options that you can set)
advanced    (to view advanced options for a specific module)
show        (to show options in a specific category)

selecting a module
Once you have found the module for the specific machine that you want to exploit, you need to select it and set the proper options. This task will take you through selecting and setting options for one of the most popular metasploit modules "eternalblue". All basic commands that could be run before selecting a module can also be done while a module is selected.

use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue        (to select the eternalblue module)
info use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue       (to get more information about the module)
RHOSTS        (to select the target host(s))
RPORT         (to set the target port(TCP))
set           (to set options)
SMBPass       (The password for the specified username)
SMBUser       (The username to authenticate as)
set SMBPass username        (to set SMBPass to "username")
set SMBUser password        (to set the SMBUser to "password)
arch          (sets the architecture to be exploited)
payload       (sets the payload to be sent to the target machine)
exploit       (to run the exploit after setting all the required options)
-j            (set this flag if you want the exploit to run in the background)
sessions      (list all current sessions)
-i            (flag to go into interactive mode with a session("drops either into a meterpreter or regular shell"))
