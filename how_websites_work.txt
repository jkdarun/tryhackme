JAVASCRIPT
to make a webpage interactive, to control functionality of webpages
loaded within <script> tags or can be included remotely with the src attribute: <script src="/location/of/javascript_file.js"></script>

The following JavaScript code finds a HTML element on the page with the id of "demo" and changes the element's contents to "Hack the Planet" : document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hack the Planet";

HTML elements can also have events, such as "onclick" or "onhover" that execute JavaScript when the event occurs. The following code changes the text of the element with the demo ID to Button Clicked:
<button onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Button Clicked";'>Click Me!</button>


Sensitive Data Exposure 
Whenever you're assessing a web application for security issues, one of the first things you should do is review the page source code to see if you can find any exposed login credentials or hidden links.
